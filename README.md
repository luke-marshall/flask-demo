# Getting Started

1. You can skip this if you want and install the dependencies yourself - i think this is just flask at the moment. I recommend using pipenv though - install it with your favoured package manager, then just run `pipenv install`

2. Run run.py - if you've installed the packages to your machine, just `python run.py` or if you're using pipenv, use `pipenv run python run.py`
